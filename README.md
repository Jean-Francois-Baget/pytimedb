# pytimedb

This project aims at providing tools for importing time-related data imported in RDF/S (using owl:time), and store it in a database (mongodb) while computing all consequences of the inserted data (and detecting inconsistencies).

This work is part of the ICODA project (https://project.inria.fr/icoda/).
